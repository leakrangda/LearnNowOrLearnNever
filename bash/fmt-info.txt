	`fmt` reads from the specified FILE arguments (or standard input if none are given), and writes to standard output.

	by default, blank lines, spaces between words, and identation are preserved in the output; successive input lines with different identation are not joined; tabs are expanded on input and introduced on output.

	`fmt` prefers breaking lines at the end of a sentence, and tries to avoid line breaks after the first word of a sentence or before the last words of a sentence. A "sentence break" is defined as ecihter the spaces or end of line, ignoring any itervening parentheses or quotes. LIke TeX, `fmt` reads entire "paragraphs" before choosing line breaks; the algorithm is a variant of that given by donald e. knuth and michael f. plass in "breaking paragraphs into lines",
